# Feature Encoding & Scaling Project

This project focuses on feature encoding and scaling using Python.
The objective is to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.

## Dataset:
Adult Income Dataset

## Tools Used:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## Steps Performed:
Identified categorical and numerical features
Applied Label Encoding where order exists
Applied One-Hot Encoding where order does not exist
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
Saved the processed dataset

## Output:
Preprocessed dataset
Notebook

## Conclusion
This project helps in understanding the basics of feature engineering,
including encoding and scaling of data.
